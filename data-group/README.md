# Data: HRV Stress Analysis Dataset

**Group:** 2026-Chen-Lin-Wang
**Authors:** Chen Wei, Lin MeiLing, Wang XiaoMing
**License:** CC-BY-4.0 (this documentation); Original dataset CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0

## Dataset Overview

### Source

This dataset contains preprocessed HRV features and labells extracted from the SWELL-KW dataset. This is only a preprocessed part of the orginal data.

**Original Source:** W. Kraaij, S. Koldijk, & M. Sappelli. (2014). The SWELL Knowledge Work Dataset for Stress and User Modeling Research.

### Statistics

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Subjects | 25 |
| Demographics | Mean age 25 ± s.d. 3.25 years; 17 male, 8 female |
| Data Length | ~3 hours |
| Sampling Rate | 500 Hz |
| Total windows | ~5,000 |
| Features | 6 HRV metrics |
| Conditions | 3 (neutral, time pressure, interruptions) |

### Format

| File | Description | Format |
|------|-------------|--------|
| `hrv_features.csv` | Extracted HRV features | CSV, UTF-8 |
| `labels.csv` | Stress condition labels | CSV, UTF-8 |
| `subject_info.csv` | Anonymized subject metadata | CSV, UTF-8 |

#### hrv_features.csv

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `subject_id` | string | Anonymized subject identifier (S01-S25) |
| `window_id` | int | Analysis window number |
| `sdnn` | float | Standard deviation of NN intervals (ms) |
| `rmssd` | float | Root mean square of successive differences (ms) |
| `pnn50` | float | Percentage of intervals > 50ms (%) |
| `lf_power` | float | Low frequency power (ms²) |
| `hf_power` | float | High frequency power (ms²) |
| `lf_hf_ratio` | float | LF/HF ratio |

#### labels.csv

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `subject_id` | string | Anonymized subject identifier |
| `window_id` | int | Analysis window number |
| `condition` | string | Stress condition (neutral/time_pressure/interruptions) |
| `stress_label` | int | Binary label (0=neutral, 1=stressed) |

### Preprocessing

1. ECG signals bandpass filtered (0.5-40 Hz) with 4th order Butterworth filter
2. R-peaks detected using Pan-Tompkins algorithm
3. HRV features computed over 3-minute windows with 50% overlap
4. Outlier windows removed (RR interval < 300ms or > 2000ms)

### Privacy

This dataset contains no personally identifiable information. Subject IDs are anonymized (S01-S25) and cannot be linked to individuals. The original SWELL-KW dataset was collected with informed consent and IRB approval.

### Usage

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load features and labels
features = pd.read_csv('hrv_features.csv')
labels = pd.read_csv('labels.csv')

# Merge on subject_id and window_id
data = features.merge(labels, on=['subject_id', 'window_id'])

# Split by subject for training/testing
train_subjects = [f'S{i:02d}' for i in range(1, 18)]
test_subjects = [f'S{i:02d}' for i in range(22, 26)]

train_data = data[data['subject_id'].isin(train_subjects)]
test_data = data[data['subject_id'].isin(test_subjects)]
```
```

## Data Format Guidelines

### Tabular Data (CSV)

- Use UTF-8 encoding
- Include header row with column names
- Use consistent delimiters (comma recommended)
- Document missing value representation (e.g., `NA`, empty string)

### Signal Data (TXT)

- One value per line for single-channel data
- Document sampling rate in README
- Include units in documentation

### Metadata (JSON)

```json

## Recommended Public Datasets

For HRV/ECG analysis projects, consider these publicly available datasets:

| Dataset | Description | License | URL |
|---------|-------------|---------|-----|
| **SWELL-KW** | Stress during knowledge work | CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0 | [Link](http://cs.ru.nl/~skoldijk/SWELL-KW/) |
| **WESAD** | Wearable stress detection | CC-BY-4.0 | [Link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/WESAD) |
| **MIT-BIH** | Arrhythmia database | ODC-BY | [Link](https://physionet.org/content/mitdb/) |
| **PTB-XL** | Large ECG dataset | CC-BY-4.0 | [Link](https://physionet.org/content/ptb-xl/) |

---

## Why Separate Data from Code?

| Reason | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Size** | Datasets are large (>1 GB); code is small (~100 KB) |
| **Versioning** | Data rarely changes; code evolves frequently |
| **Licensing** | Data has restrictions (non-commercial); code is Apache-2.0 |
| **Reproducibility** | Others can use the code with different datasets |
| **Git efficiency** | Large binary files shouldn't be in code repositories |
