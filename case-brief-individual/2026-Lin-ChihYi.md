## Problem Statement

A health monitoring system needs to monitor ECG signals from multiple users for HRV analysis and anomaly detection. The challenge is that the system currently uses a single fixed ECG analysis workflow. This lacks consideration for individual differences, causing usable ECG data to be misjudged as unreliable and requiring significant manual re-analysis.

## Context/Background

System receives 30–50 ECG segments per user daily, each 30–60 seconds long.Even with only a few users, there are clear differences in resting heart rate, baseline HRV, and signal noise patterns between individuals.Most segments are normal and usable but are often flagged due to noise or individual variations.Current workflows are inflexible and cannot automatically retry alternative strategies upon failure.

## Analysis
### Root Causes

- Ignoring Individual Differences: Applying uniform thresholds leads to high misclassification rates.

- Fixed Processing Workflow: Analysis cannot adapt to different signal qualities or individual traits.

- Manual Overload: Technical staff must manually review and filter results, leading to high labor costs.

### Constraints

- Must handle multiple individuals simultaneously without increasing human burden.

- Must operate 24/7 without segment-by-segment manual intervention.

- System must be scalable for more individuals without redesigning the core process.

### Requirements

- Real-time processing of ECG data from multiple sources.

- Adaptive filtering and R-peak detection based on personal historical data.

- Automatic quality judgment to accept or reject results based on physiological credibility.

## Proposed Approach (Chat-based)

A technician could:

- Collect basic individual info (sampling rate, expected ranges) and copy-paste ECG data into the chat.

- Analyze using the LLM to suggest analysis methods and generate HRV results.

- Recommend a result for the user to manually judge for credibility (based on visible HRV consistency and obvious RR interval anomalies).

- Learn by re-inputting user info if the LLM forgets the specific context,with no systematic tracking of HRV stability or error rates.

## Proposed Approach (Agentic)

An AI agent system could:

- Collect ECG signal segments and Person IDs through the Ingestion Module,enabling per-subject tracking of HRV statistics across segments.

- Analyze by querying historical heart rate baselines and choosing adaptive filtering strategies,with each strategy evaluated using internal quality metrics.

- Recommend HRV metrics (SDNN, RMSSD) only if they pass internal physiological assessment. (e.g., low invalid RR ratio and stable HRV across retries).

- Learn by updating individual memory with successful results and logging failure reasons for optimization,supporting longitudinal evaluation of HRV stability and error reduction.


## Expected Outcomes

- Reduction in manual review time for ECG and HRV data.

- Improved consistency by establishing personalized heart rate baselines for each user.

- Automatic filtering of low-quality signals to minimize false anomalies.

- Scalable architecture that naturally extends from 1 to many users.
