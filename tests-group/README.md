- Report generation

## Test Summary

| Category | Total | Passed | Failed |
|----------|-------|--------|--------|
| Unit Tests | 12 | 11 | 1 |
| Integration Tests | 5 | 5 | 0 |
| End-to-End Tests | 3 | 2 | 1 |
| **Total** | **20** | **18** | **2** |

**Pass Rate:** 90%

## Usage

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/

# Run specific test category
python -m pytest tests/test_tools.py
```

## Known Issues

1. TC-003 fails on corrupted data files (expected behavior, but error message unclear)
2. TC-018 timeout on very large files (>10 min recordings)

## Test Cases

### Unit Tests: Data Loader

#### TC-001: Load Valid ECG File

- **Description:** Verify that a valid ECG text file loads correctly
- **Preconditions:** Sample ECG file exists at test path
- **Input:** `sample_ecg.txt` (500 Hz, 6-minute recording)
- **Expected Output:** NumPy array with 180,000 samples
- **Actual Output:** NumPy array with 180,000 samples
- **Status:** PASS

#### TC-002: Handle Missing File

- **Description:** Verify graceful handling of missing file
- **Preconditions:** None
- **Input:** `nonexistent_file.txt`
- **Expected Output:** FileNotFoundError with descriptive message
- **Actual Output:** FileNotFoundError: "File not found: nonexistent_file.txt"
- **Status:** PASS

#### TC-003: Handle Corrupted File

- **Description:** Verify handling of corrupted/malformed data
- **Preconditions:** Corrupted file with non-numeric content
- **Input:** `corrupted_ecg.txt`
- **Expected Output:** ValueError with line number of error
- **Actual Output:** ValueError: "Could not convert string to float"
- **Status:** FAIL
- **Notes:** Error message does not indicate which line caused the problem

### Unit Tests: Signal Processing

#### TC-004: Bandpass Filter Frequency Response

- **Description:** Verify filter passes 0.5-40 Hz, attenuates outside
- **Preconditions:** None
- **Input:** Synthetic signal with known frequency components
- **Expected Output:** >90% power in passband, <10% outside
- **Actual Output:** 94% in passband, 4% outside
- **Status:** PASS

#### TC-005: R-Peak Detection Accuracy

- **Description:** Verify R-peak detection on annotated dataset
- **Preconditions:** MIT-BIH sample with known R-peak locations
- **Input:** Record 100 from MIT-BIH database
- **Expected Output:** Sensitivity >95%, Precision >95%
- **Actual Output:** Sensitivity 97.2%, Precision 96.8%
- **Status:** PASS

### Integration Tests

#### TC-010: Full Pipeline Execution

- **Description:** Verify complete pipeline from file to report
- **Preconditions:** Valid ECG file, trained model
- **Input:** `sample_ecg_6min.txt`
- **Expected Output:** PDF report with HRV metrics and classification
- **Actual Output:** PDF generated with all expected sections
- **Status:** PASS
- **Execution Time:** 28 seconds

### End-to-End Tests

#### TC-018: Large File Processing

- **Description:** Verify system handles 30-minute recording
- **Preconditions:** Large ECG file
- **Input:** `large_ecg_30min.txt` (900,000 samples)
- **Expected Output:** Complete processing within 5 minutes
- **Actual Output:** Timeout after 10 minutes
- **Status:** FAIL
- **Notes:** Memory usage exceeded available RAM; needs optimization

## Test Results Analysis

### Result Summary

Overall pass rate: 90% (18/20 tests)

### Failed Tests Analysis

#### TC-003: Handle Corrupted File

**Root Cause:** The data loader catches the ValueError from NumPy but does not
preserve line number information when re-raising.

**Impact:** Low - user cannot identify exact location of corruption, but the
file is still rejected appropriately.

**Recommendation:** Enhance error handling to include line number in exception
message.

#### TC-018: Large File Processing

**Root Cause:** The feature extraction step loads entire signal into memory
for FFT computation. 30-minute recordings at 500 Hz require ~7.2 MB for raw
data, but intermediate calculations expand this to ~500 MB.

**Impact:** Medium - system cannot process recordings longer than ~15 minutes
on machines with 8 GB RAM.

**Recommendation:** Implement windowed processing for long recordings.

### Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Average test execution time | 1.2 seconds |
| Total suite execution time | 24 seconds |
| Code coverage | 78% |

### Conclusion

The system passes core functionality tests. Two failures identified are
edge cases that do not affect normal operation but should be addressed
in future iterations.
```

## Best Practices for Testing

### Test Design
- Test both normal operation and edge cases
- Include positive tests (should work) and negative tests (should fail gracefully)
- Use realistic test data when possible
- Document assumptions and constraints

### Test Data
- Use anonymized or synthetic data only
- Document data sources and generation methods
- Include sample data files in your submission
- Never include real patient data

### Documentation
- Write tests as if someone else will run them
- Include setup instructions
- Explain any non-obvious test logic
- Analyze failures, don't just report them
